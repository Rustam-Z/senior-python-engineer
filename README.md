*By Rustam-Z üöÄ*

Can be used by Backend Developers, Data Engineers, Automation Engineers, and anyone who wants to advance in Python.

## Senior Python Developer Skill Set
- Advanced Python topics
  - Object model, data structures (mutable and immutable, shallow and deep copy, dict hashing, data type caching in Python)
  - Dataclasses, `collections` 
  - Decorators
  - Iterators, generators
  - Context managers
  - Advanced topics in OOP (Method Resolution Order MRO, diamond problem inheretance, dunder methods, ABC abstract class, super(), descriptors, property, method overriding and overloading, duck typing, monkey patching, mixin)
  - Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
  - Concurency: threading and multiprocessing
  - Asynchronous programming
  - Memory management (garbage collector, stack and heap memory, reference counting, three generation garbage collection mechanism)
  - Metaprogramming (runtime code execution)
- Python clean coding, and engineering excellence.
  - *Check resources below ‚¨áÔ∏è*
- Development principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
  - [SOLID](https://github.com/Rustam-Z/senior-python-engineer/tree/main/solid)
- [Coding design patterns](https://github.com/Rustam-Z/senior-python-engineer/tree/main/design_patterns#design-patterns-with-python)
- Testing
  - Mocking, patching, fixtures
  - PyTest, unittest for unit, integration testing
  - Selenium for UI end-to-end testing
  - Code coverage and static analysis tools
- Profiling and optimization with `cProfile`
- Package and environment management (Poetr, PyPi)
